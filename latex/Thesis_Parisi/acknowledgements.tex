This thesis would not be possible without unique insights and guidance from my advisor, Chris Roman, and committee members Mingxi Zhou and Peter Swaszek. This thesis furthers Kristopher Krasnosky's dissertation; Kris' time and effort were crucial to success. Dr. Tzu-Ting Chen provided a valuable perspective on sonar uncertainty, and I am grateful for her advice. Last but not least, thank you to my fellow lab mates for keeping me focused and laughing along the way.
