In this paper we further the capabilities of Massively Parallel Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in two ways. The first introduces data reduction techniques to minimize inputs to the GPR algorithm while maintaining solution accuracy above a threshold. Various approaches are analyzed to find an optimal data minimization strategy. The second informs uncertainty predictions by considering the physics of multi-beam sonar refraction throughout the water column. In tandem, the presented methodologies decrease the GPR algorithm run-time and increase the fidelity of uncertainty predictions. The program requires a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) to run and is implemented using the Robot Operating System (ROS) with C++. The algorithm was performed on pre-recorded ROS data (ROSbag) of a field survey conducted using a WASSP multi-beam sonar system at the Wiggles Bank on St. Mary's River in Georgia, USA.
